  theorems from Ramanujan in the first two letters, but there were
  many more results and theorems in the notebooks. Hardy saw that some
  were wrong, others had already been discovered, and the rest were
  new breakthroughs. Ramanujan left a deep impression on Hardy and
  Littlewood. Littlewood commented, "I can believe that he's at least
  a Jacobi", while Hardy said he "can compare him only with Euler or
  Jacobi."`,

  composite numbers, sections of the first part of which had been
  published the preceding year in the Proceedings of the London
  Mathematical Society. The paper was more than 50 pages long and
  proved various properties of such numbers. Hardy disliked this topic
  area but remarked that though it engaged with what he called the
  'backwater of mathematics', in it Ramanujan displayed 'extraordinary
  mastery over the algebra of inequalities'.`,
